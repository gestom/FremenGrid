  <description>Frequency Map Enhancement</description>

  Frequency Map Enhancement is an idea that allows to introduce dynamics into spatial models used in the mobile robotics domain.
Many of these spatial models describe the enviroment by a set of discrete components with binary states.
For example, cells of an occupancy grid are occupied or free, edges of a topological map are traversable or not, doors are opened or closed, rooms are vacant or occupied, landmarks are visible or occluded, etc.
Typically, the state of each model component is uncertain, because it is measured indirectly by means of sensors which are affected by noise.

The idea assumes that in populated evironments, many of the observed changes are caused by humans performing their daily activities. 
Therefore, the environment's dynamics can be modeled by its frequency spectrum, as a combination of harmonic functions that correspond to periodic processes influencing the environment. 
Such a representation not only allows representation of environment dynamics over arbitrary timescales with constant memory requirements, but also prediction of future environment states. 
The proposed approach can be applied to many of the state-of-the-art environment models. 

Models like occupancy grids, topological or landmark maps can be easily extended by FreMEn.
We present experiments using data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor environment over a period of one month, where frequency-enhanced models were compared to their static counterparts in four scenarios: i) 3D map building, ii) environment state prediction, iii) topological localisation and iv) anomaly detection, in order to verify the model's ability to detect unusual events. In all these cases, the frequency-enhanced models outperformed their static counterparts.
